Paths are turned back into dirt if a ship moves into a space where those
blocks were solid. (E.g. moving a ship over a copy of itself.)

So, in the future fill the destination volume with air before moving.

This can double as the "am I at the build limit" check, though the "is the
destination air" check should catch that.
