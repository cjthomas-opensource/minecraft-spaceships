# Chris's Spaceship Datapack

## Overview

This datapack provides a set of functions intended to make "spaceship"
structures move in vanilla Minecraft. A "spaceship" is a volume of space
of a predefined size (such as 8x8x8); running the appropriate function (from
a command block) makes the ship teleport in the desired direction by the
desired distance. Spaceships usually have a "flight console" set up with
several of these command blocks to move in several different directions.

**FIXME** - Pictures and a tutorial go here.

## Installation

* Use `dobuild` to regenerate the datapack contents, if necessary.
* Use `dorelease` to rebuild the datapack .zip file, if necessary.
* Copy `releases/CJTspaceships.zip` to the `datapacks` folder in your
  world save.
