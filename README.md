# Chris's Spaceship Datapack

## Overview

This datapack provides a set of functions intended to make "spaceship"
structures move in vanilla Minecraft. A "spaceship" is a volume of space
of a predefined size (such as 8x8x8); running the appropriate function (from
a command block) makes the ship teleport in the desired direction by the
desired distance. Spaceships usually have a "flight console" set up with
several of these command blocks to move in several different directions.

**FIXME** - Pictures and a tutorial go here.

## Installation

As of 07 Jan 2024, files have to be manually copied to the target datapack
folder (either a server-based folder or a save folder). The `pack.mcmeta`
file is copied to the top-level folder, and the `functions` folder and its
subfolders are copied to `data/cjt_ship/functions` in the top-level folder.

_(This is the end of the file.)_
